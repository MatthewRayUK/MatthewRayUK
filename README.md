Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew!

I'm a **Junior Backend Python Developer** from the UK who enjoys **building applications through their full development lifecycle, learning and growing with every step.**

---

ðŸš€ **What I'm Busy With:**
Right now, you'll find me building backend services with **Python** and **FastAPI**, creating **SQL** database solutions, and **diving into frontend development with React**. I'm focused on writing clean, testable code (**Pytest**, **Pydantic**) and getting things deployed smoothly using **Docker**. I'm also **actively practicing deployment patterns with Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, helping make development workflows smarter with **CI/CD** (GitHub Actions).


---

ðŸŒ± **What's Currently Sparking My Curiosity:**
* Figuring out the finer points of **Kubernetes** orchestration and cluster management
* Getting to grips with optimizing cloud-native architectures on **GCP**
* Exploring advanced distributed system patterns for even greater scalability

---

ðŸ’¡ **My Journey & What I Bring to the Table:**
I've made the leap into software development from a dynamic background in **education** and **data analysis**. As an **Assistant Head Teacher**, I led teams, drove initiatives, and sharpened my strategic problem-solving skills. My time as a **Data Analyst** gave me a deep dive into analytics with Power BI and SQL, plus valuable experience communicating complex insights. Being primarily **self-taught** in development, means I bring a truly collaborative, user-focused approach to building software and excel at bridging technical concepts for anyone.
